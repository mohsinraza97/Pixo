<p align="center">  
Pixo is a small demo application based on Modern Android application tech-stacks and mix MVVM & MVI Architecture.<br>This project is for focusing especially on the Jetpack Libraries like Hilt for dependency injection and Paging 3.<br>
Also fetching data from the network via repository pattern.

## Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- Minimum SDK level 21
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) based, [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) + [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/) for asynchronous.
- Animations (Shared element transitions - Fade in/out)
- JetPack
  - LiveData - notify domain layer data to views.
  - Lifecycle - dispose of observing data when lifecycle state changes.
  - ViewModel - UI related data holder, lifecycle aware.
  - Hilt (alpha) for dependency injection.
  - Paging 3 - load and display pages of data from a larger dataset.
  - Navigation - (save args) for navigation between fragments.
  - Databinding - (bind adapters) to bind UI components in layouts to data sources.
  - KTX - Provide concise, idiomatic Kotlin to Jetpack, Android platform, and other APIs.
- Architecture
  - MVI Architecture (Model - View - Intent)
  - MVVM Architecture (View - Model - Model - View)
  - Android Unidirectional Data Flow - Kotlin Flow
  - Repository pattern
- [Retrofit2 & OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/retrofit) - construct the REST APIs and paging network data.
- [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) - A JSON library for Kotlin and Java.
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - loading images.
- [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) - logging.
- [Material-Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Material design components like ripple animation, cardView.

## Open API

Pixo using the [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/) for constructing RESTful API.<br>
Pixabay API provides a RESTful API interface to highly detailed objects built from thousands of lines of data related to Images.
